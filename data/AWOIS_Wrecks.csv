 DESCRIPTION
 **** IN THE MID 1940'S, PROBABLY DURING A CHART RECONSTRUCTION AND INSET, THE OIL BARGE (IF EVER CHARTED), WAS DELETED FROM THE CHART AND THE SS JOHN WORTHINGTON  (AWOIS # 5020) WAS CHARTED.  A REASONABLE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE EAST BANK OF THE CHANNEL MIGRATED 50-100 METERS EAST WHICH PUT THE ONCE CLOSE INSHORE WRECK OF THE OIL BARGE (AWOIS #5016) OFFSHORE,  AT THE SAME TIME THE WORTHINGTON WAS BEACHED ON THE EAST SHORE IN 1945. (UPDATED 9/1999 RWD)
 **** RECORDS FROM MR. LEDET (8TH CGD) SEPT 99, OF A COE INVESTIGATION (ASSUMED 8/91) SHOW THAT A 8.6FT DEPTH AT MLLW WAS OBTAINED AT LAT 27/51/42W, LONG 97/03/04. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN FILE I77-91  ADDRESSED IN LNM37/1991, AS DISCUSSED WITH MR. LEDET (TELCON 6/25/2001).  THE SURVEY PLOT IS ILLEGIBLE HOWEVER THE COVER LETTER STATES THAT ""NO SUNKEN VESSEL WAS FOUND... A MOUND OF SAND IS THE ONLY THING THAT WAS FOUND AND ITS HIGHEST POINT IS APPROX. 8-9FT BELOW THE SURFACE "".

  H11285/03--SSS and SWMB data were acquired within the AWOIS radius.  A contact resembling a wreck was found on the bottom and SWMB indicated a least depth of 45.37ft (13.83m).  The feature was investigated by ship's divers who found a wreck resting upside down with its keel towards the surface.  The least depth gauge calculated depth was 46.11ft (14.04m).  Hydrographer recommended removing 36ft wreck and charting a wreck with a least depth of 45ft.  Cartographer reaccepted a 
shoaler sounding and recommended charting the wreck with a least depth of 42ft.  (Entered 8/04 by CG)

  H11088--S-E906-BH-01;  Due to shoal water depths, the entire search radius for this item was not
investigated. Approximately 25% of the radius was covered with 200% SSS. Although no contacts were
located within the radius, the Hydrographer notes that the position data in the AWOIS record is very
inconsistent. The original reported position is located on shore at the southern tip of James Island. The
revised position in the AWOIS record is located 3,850m SW of the original position. Also, the closest
charted wreck PA is located 450 m south of the revised position. The hydrographer is assuming that
this is the corresponding charted feature, as a separate AWOIS number is not listed for it. The contact
referenced in this report appears to be a cabin cruiser, approximately 33 ft long, located 1,550 m WSW of
the revised position in the AWOIS record. Knowing that a small, submerged boat has the potential to
drift a significant distance due to currents in the area, the hydrographer believes this wreck to be the one
referenced in AWOIS 11,935. The hydrographer recommends ADDING a 53 Wk w/ danger curve at 38° 27' 43.75"" N, 076° 21' 54.32"" W, and retaining the wreck PA as charted. (PTT 9/29/06)."

SONARGRAMS DEPICT THE WRECK OF A LARGE SAILING VESSEL AS EVIDENCED BY IMAGES OF PROMINENT BOWSPRIT AND MAST STUBS.  ALSO CLEARLY SHOWN WERE THREE LARGE SQUARE CARGO HATCHES.  ALL THESE ATTRIBUTES PLUS THE SIZE OF THE WRECK (185.9 Feets)  AND LOCAL HISTORY (BELOW) INDICATE THAT THIS IS THE WRECK OF THE ""MAXWELL"".  DUE TO POOR VIS., NO DIVE OPS UNDERTAKEN.  ECHO-SOUNDER LD OF 52 Feets OBTAINED ON TIP OF BOWSPRIT IN LAT. 38-55-57.707N, LONG. 76-23-37,639W.   EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS RETAINING CHARTED DEPTH OF 50 Feets ON WRECK BUT REVISING TO PRESENT SURVEY POSITION AND DELETING NOTATION ""REP(1987)"" ON ALL AFFECTED CHARTS.  EVALUATOR ALSO CONSIDERS AWOIS NO. 4456 (DERRICK BARGE) AND AWOIS NO. 9424 (""MAXWELL"") TO BE THE SAME ITEM.

OPR-B370-TJ-04-- Chart AWOIS Item #2729 non-dangerous sunken wreck, least depth known 122 Feets, and text ""Wk"" at the present survey position in Latitude 41°09'19.290""N, Longitude 072°25'00.591""W.This feature is the least depth over a wreck that was located with 100% MBES (EM 1002) and developed with 100% SSS (KLEIN 5500). The wreck is approximately 23 meters long and 5 meters wide. The feature is located 1.1 meters from the position of AWOIS 2729 and approximately 10 meters outside the 1850-meter search radius of AWOIS 1813. Although the current feature does not lie within the 1850-meter search radius of another AWOIS item, #1814, the history for AWOIS 2729 indicates that a past hydrographer believed
that AWOIS 2729 may have been the wreck of AWOIS 1814 (the tug ""Thames""), whose 1850-meter search radius (1) is centered 4240 meters to the northwest and (2) does not contain any wrecks. The current hydrographer is unable to definitively substantiate the past claim that the wreck of AWOIS 2729 is the wreck of AWOIS 1814 because (1) no diver investigation
was done and (2) the current feature does not precisely match the description of the tug ""Thames"" provided in AWOIS 1814's proprietary section; however, the current feature does closely match the length and width dimensions of AWOIS 1813 (believed to the tug ""Barataria""), although the hydrographer can not definately say wether or not the current feature is indeed the wreck of AWOIS 1813 because no diver investigation was performed and another wreck also closely matches the description of AWOIS 1813 (RES 11/30/07).

Although the wreck is evident is the SSS data, the wreck has such little height that it does not show up in the MBES data; however, by comparing landmarks and reference points in both the SSS and MBES data, the hydrographer concluded that the current feature's position is the position of the wreck, within approximately 10 meters.

Update AWOIS Item #2730 database position and depth (AWOIS database estimated depth was incorrect with a value of 79ft while raster chart 12354 (41st Ed., Apr./04) portrays the correct depth value of 123 Feets.This feature is the least depth over a wreck that appears to be a submerged barge. The wreck was located with 100% MBES (EM 1002) and developed with 100% SSS (KLEIN 5500) and 100% MBES (RESON 8101). The wreck is 32.5 meters long and 5 meters wide. The feature is located within the 200-meter search radius for AWOIS 2730 (a charted 123-foot reported non-dangerous wreck) and the 2000-meter search raduis for AWOIS 1813 (a charted wreck believed to be the tug ""Barataria""). The history for AWOIS 2730 indicates that a past hydrographer believed that AWOIS 2730 may have been the wreck represented by AWOIS 1813; however, the current hydrographer is unable to definitively substantiate this claim since (1) no diver investigation was done and (2) the current feature does not correspond to the description of the Barataria included in the proprietary section of AWOIS 1813 (which describes a wreck 20.9 by 5.5 meters). NOTE: From the AWOIS descriptions, it appears the past hydrographer based his claim on knowing about only two wrecks. The current survey data show a total of five wrecks within or very near the search radii of AWOIS 1813, two of which (addressed in other feature reports) do indeed correspond to the AWOIS description (RES 11/30/07).

This is not consistent with his indication that the Hercules was 108' in length and powered by coal engines.  Mr. Munro indicates that John Stanford of Jamestown, RI has located the Hercules with a least depth of 11' at 41/19.408 north lat, 71/47.468w lon (NAD83) in 14' of water approximately 100 yards south of Misquamicit Beach, RI.  Mr. Munro indicates that Mr. Stanford has dove on the wreck and reports it as contiguous and consisting of the keel and plating to just above the turn of the bilge and an iron propeller.
